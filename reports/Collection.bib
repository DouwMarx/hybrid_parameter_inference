abstract = {The aim of this work is to provide a new model describing the dynamic behavior of the rotating machinery working under non-stationary conditions with no assumption on the IAS. This new model will provide an identification tool for the rotor parameters. An example of a simple rotor made of a flexible shaft, a rigid disk, bearings and a mass unbalance is considered. The model shows a coupling between the torsional and flexural behavior and it is proven that, owing to this coupled behavior, the signal of the IAS contains information about, not only the rotation frequency of the response of the rotor, but also about its flexural behavior, when operating under non-stationary conditions.},

abstract = {The growing use of rotating machines operating in non-stationary conditions gave rise to a greater need to a higher precision for describing their dynamic behavior. The latter has always been based on a certain number of simplifying assumptions. In particular, the spinning speed is considered either constant or following a given law of variation as a function of time, resulting in a dynamic model that is limited to specific operating conditions. The aim of this work is to present a more general dynamic model of rotating machines, which accurately reflects its behavior in real working conditions. No assumption is made on the speed of rotation; it is included as an unknown of the dynamic problem by introducing a degree of freedom combining both the free body rotation and the torsional deformation. The instantaneous angular speed (IAS) is then deduced not only from the induced torque, but also from the whole dynamic behavior of the structure taking into account the periodic geometry (e.g.: Gears, bearings) as well as the operating conditions (e.g.: Going through the critical speeds). Making no assumption on the angular speed leads to a new formulation of the gyroscopic effect strongly present at very high speeds. This new formulation shows a coupling between the different degrees of freedom as well as a nonlinear behavior of the structure. The results of both classic and new formulations are compared for an architecture of a rotating machine to highlight the utility of the innovative approach in non-stationary operating conditions.},

abstract = {In the automotive industry, high-speed elecrical engines will be used in a very large range of speeds, leading to non-stationary operating conditions. Thus more critical speeds may be crossed a very large number of times during the whole life-time of the engine. Therefore, estimating accurately the non-stationary loads and deformations during these transient regimes is of first importance for a correct design. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic model for unbalanced high-speed rotors with less restrictive assumptions. The finite element model accounts for flexion, torsion and traction-compression leading to six degrees of freedom on each node. The non-ideal energy source is considered and the rotor is running under non-stationary operating conditions and crossing supercritical speeds. The angular displacement is defined in such a way that it combines simultaneously the intrinsic nominal rotation and the torsional deformation. The comparison of the proposed model with other models under different assumptions on the energy source and on the bending-torsion coupling shows that our model offers more accurate prediction for both lateral and torsional vibrations when crossing critical speeds. The ability of the proposed model to account for the mutual influence between lateral and torsional behavior is highlighted and is exhibited through time-frequency analyses.},
